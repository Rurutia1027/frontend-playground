# Classes Notes

Under folder of `classes`, we delcare class and its child classes.
In the scope of the class, we define series of getter and setter functions, and at the end of the file of `classes.js` we use keyword `export` to expose functions and classes to outer folder so that those 'exposed' function, classes can be imported, and used in the index.js.

`index.js` this is generated as the entry point file by command `npm init`.

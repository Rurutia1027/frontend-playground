Welcome to the **Frontend Playground**! ðŸŽ¨ This repository is a collection of projects and experiments aimed at learning and mastering **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## To-Do List

- [x] [Tailwind sandbox demo codes](./tailwind-css-sandbox/)
- [ ] [Tailwind projects (in progress)](./tailwind-css-projects/)
- [ ] Tailwind and Figma projects (not yet started)
- [ ] JavaScript projects (not yet started)
- [ ] Node.js & Next.js backend integration (not yet started)
- [ ] React and Tailwind small projects (not yet started)

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

```
frontend-playground/
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind-css-sandbox/       # Hands-on Tailwind CSS experiments and small projects
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind-css-projects/      # Larger projects showcasing Tailwind CSS in action
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/workflows/          # CI/CD workflows for deployment
```

### 1. [tailwind-css-sandbox](https://rurutia1027.github.io/frontend-playground/tailwind-css-sandbox/index.html)

This folder contains small, focused experiments with Tailwind CSS, such as trying out utility classes, transitions, and layouts. Ideal for quick prototypes or testing new ideas.

### 2. [tailwind-css-projects](./tailwind-css-projects/)

This folder is for larger projects built with Tailwind CSS. These projects are more structured and aim to demonstrate real-world use cases of Tailwind CSS in modern web development.

### 3. [GitHub Action Build & Deploy](https://github.com/Rurutia1027/frontend-playground/actions)

This folder contains the CI/CD configuration files for deploying projects. Each project has been set up to deploy its static assets (like `index.html` and related files) to GitHub Pages.

## Goals

The primary goals of this repository are:

1. **Learn Tailwind CSS**: Explore the utility-first approach of styling with Tailwind and master its features.
2. **Improve JavaScript Skills**: Build interactive components and dynamic functionalities.
3. **Dive into React**: Begin experimenting with React to build reusable components and stateful applications.

## Deployment

Projects in this repository are deployed using GitHub Pages. For example, static sites (like those in the `tailwind-css-sandbox`) are automatically published using the CI/CD pipeline configured in `.github/workflows/`.

Once deployed, access them at:

- **GitHub Pages URL**: `https://rurutia1027.github.io/frontend-playground/tailwind-css-sandbox/index.html`
